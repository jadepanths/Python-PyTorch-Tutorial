Basic PyTorch Tutorials in Python 

### Installation
Install an IDE on your local device like [IDLE](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows), or [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/).  I personally recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) as it has an excellent debugger, sophisticated autocompletion, and refactoring support.

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is an toolkit that include open-source packages and libraries. You will need this to install libraries and manage environments where you will compile your code in.

Check if your computer/labtop is ***CUDA-capable*** CUDA is limited to ***NVIDIA*** GPU. If you know what GPU you have, you can simply check if it CUDA capable here [CUDA GPUS LIST](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). If you do not know what GPU do you have, Open "Run" in the window search bar or the start menu. Then run this command: ```control /name Microsoft.DeviceManager```. Then go to your Display Adapters to check your GPUs.
